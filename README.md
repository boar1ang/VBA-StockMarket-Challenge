# VBA-StockMarket-Challenge
This is a repo containing my solution to the VBA Challenge homework assignment for the U of MN Data Visualization & Analytics Boot Camp.
I created a single VBA script to run on 3 year's of real stock market data. For each stock I calculated the yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, the percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, and the total volume of the stock. For each year (2014-2016) I then calculated the greatest percent increase, the greatest percent decrease, and the greatest total volume. Included in my VBA script was code for conditional formatting of the results.

This repo contains my VBA script, the stock market data, and a screen shot of the data after the script has run.
